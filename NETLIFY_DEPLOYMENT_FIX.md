# Netlify Deployment MIME Type Fix

## Problem

The deployed site was serving CSS and JavaScript files with incorrect MIME type ('text/html' instead of 'text/css' and 'application/javascript'). This was causing the browser to refuse loading these files.

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by Netlify's redirect configuration that was redirecting ALL requests (including static assets) to `/index.html` for Single Page Application (SPA) routing.

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Updated `netlify.toml`

- Set `force = false` on the catch-all redirect to allow static files to be served directly
- Added specific MIME type headers for CSS, JS, and MJS files
- Added cache headers for better performance

### 2. Created `public/_redirects`

- Added explicit rules to serve static assets directly before the SPA catch-all
- This file takes precedence over `netlify.toml` redirects

### 3. Optimized Vite Build Configuration

- Ensured proper asset file naming
- Added `assetsDir: "assets"` to maintain consistent asset paths
- Improved build output structure

### 4. Added Test Files

- Created `deployment-test.json` to verify static file serving
- This can be used to test if the deployment is working correctly

## How to Test the Fix

### Local Testing

1. Build the project: `npm run build`
2. Preview locally: `npm run preview`
3. Check that assets load correctly at http://localhost:4173

### Deployment Testing

1. Deploy to Netlify
2. Test static asset serving: `https://yourdomain.netlify.app/deployment-test.json`
3. Check browser console for MIME type errors
4. Verify CSS and JS files load correctly

## Files Modified/Created

- `netlify.toml` - Updated redirect and header configuration
- `public/_redirects` - Created with explicit asset serving rules
- `vite.config.ts` - Optimized build configuration
- `public/deployment-test.json` - Test file for verifying deployment
- `package.json` - Added preview script

## Key Changes Explained

### Netlify Redirects Priority

```
# Static assets served first
/assets/*  /assets/:splat  200
/favicon.ico  /favicon.ico  200

# SPA routing fallback (only for non-asset requests)
/*  /index.html  200
```

### MIME Type Headers

```toml
[[headers]]
  for = "*.css"
  [headers.values]
    Content-Type = "text/css"

[[headers]]
  for = "*.js"
  [headers.values]
    Content-Type = "application/javascript"
```

### Build Configuration

```js
build: {
  assetsDir: "assets",
  rollupOptions: {
    output: {
      entryFileNames: "assets/[name]-[hash].js",
      chunkFileNames: "assets/[name]-[hash].js",
      assetFileNames: "assets/[name]-[hash][extname]",
    },
  },
}
```

## Expected Results

After deployment, the following should work without MIME type errors:

- CSS files load with `Content-Type: text/css`
- JavaScript files load with `Content-Type: application/javascript`
- Static assets are served directly without redirects
- SPA routing still works for application routes
- Performance is improved with proper caching headers

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:

1. Clear browser cache and hard refresh
2. Check Netlify deploy logs for build errors
3. Verify the `dist` folder contains the expected assets
4. Test the deployment-test.json endpoint
5. Check browser network tab for 404s or incorrect MIME types
