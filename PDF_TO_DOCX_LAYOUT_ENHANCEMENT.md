# PDF to DOCX Layout Preservation Enhancement

## Problem

User reported that the PDF to DOCX conversion was not preserving the original layout and structure of documents. The converted DOCX files were missing proper formatting, spacing, alignment, and document structure.

## Root Cause Analysis

The original implementation had several limitations:

1. **Basic text extraction** - Simple text extraction without spatial awareness
2. **Limited structure detection** - Basic heading and list detection
3. **No layout preservation** - Missing table, column, and alignment detection
4. **Insufficient formatting** - Limited content type recognition and styling

## Enhancements Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Text Extraction (`backend/routes/pdf.js`)

**Spatial-Aware Extraction:**

- Added enhanced extraction method that preserves spatial positioning
- Implemented line break detection based on Y-axis positioning
- Added horizontal spacing detection for better layout preservation
- Multiple fallback extraction methods for better reliability

**Key Features:**

- Position-based line break detection
- Spacing preservation between elements
- Enhanced error handling with multiple extraction strategies

### 2. Advanced Document Structure Analysis

**Comprehensive Layout Detection:**

- **Tables**: Enhanced detection of tabular data using pipes, tabs, and spacing patterns
- **Columns**: Detection of columnar layouts based on line length patterns
- **Text Alignment**: Recognition of center, right, and left-aligned content
- **Page Elements**: Detection of headers, footers, page numbers
- **Content Types**: Enhanced recognition of contact info, job titles, company names, dates

**Layout Complexity Assessment:**

- Simple, moderate, and complex layout classification
- Column ratio analysis for multi-column documents
- Alignment variation detection

### 3. Enhanced Content Type Detection

**Expanded Recognition Patterns:**

- **Contact Information**: Email, phone, address, LinkedIn, websites
- **Professional Content**: Job titles, company names, dates, locations
- **Document Elements**: Page numbers, footers, copyright notices
