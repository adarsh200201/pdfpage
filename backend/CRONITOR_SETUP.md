# Cronitor Setup Guide for PdfPage Keep-Alive System

This guide explains how to set up Cronitor monitoring for the keep-alive cron job that prevents your Render server from sleeping.

## Overview

The system includes:

- **Cron Job**: Runs every 14 minutes to ping the server
- **Cronitor Integration**: Monitors cron job health and sends alerts
- **Health Endpoints**: Multiple endpoints for monitoring server status

## Cronitor Dashboard Setup

### 1. Create a Cronitor Account

1. Go to [https://cronitor.io](https://cronitor.io)
2. Sign up or log in to your account
3. Navigate to your dashboard

### 2. Create a New Monitor

#### Option A: Using the Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Click "Add Monitor" in your Cronitor dashboard
2. Select "Cron Job" monitor type
3. Configure the monitor:
   - **Name**: `PdfPage Keep-Alive`
   - **Schedule**: `*/14 * * * *` (every 14 minutes)
   - **Timezone**: `UTC`
   - **Grace Period**: `5 minutes`
   - **Alert Policy**: Choose your notification preferences

#### Option B: Using the API

You can create the monitor programmatically:

```bash
curl -X POST https://cronitor.io/api/monitors \
  -H "Authorization: b612058cd75c4f23a6f7674fb9e8c09c" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "PdfPage Keep-Alive",
    "type": "job",
    "schedule": "*/14 * * * *",
    "timezone": "UTC",
    "grace_period": 5,
    "alert_policy": ["default"]
  }'
```

### 3. Get Your Monitor Key

After creating the monitor, you'll receive a **Monitor Key** (e.g., `abc123`). This is what you'll use in your environment variables.

## Environment Variables Setup

Add these environment variables to your Render deployment:

```bash
# Cronitor Configuration
CRONITOR_API_KEY=b612058cd75c4f23a6f7674fb9e8c09c
CRONITOR_MONITOR_KEY=your-monitor-key-here  # Replace with actual key from dashboard

# Server Configuration
RENDER_SERVER_URL=https://pdf-backend-935131444417.asia-south1.run.app
NODE_ENV=production
```

## Testing the Setup

### 1. Manual Testing

Once deployed, you can test the system using these endpoints:

```bash
# Check cron job status
curl https://pdf-backend-935131444417.asia-south1.run.app/api/cron/status

# Manual ping test
curl -X POST https://pdf-backend-935131444417.asia-south1.run.app/api/cron/ping

# Test Cronitor connection
curl -X POST https://pdf-backend-935131444417.asia-south1.run.app/api/cron/test-cronitor

# Check server health
curl https://pdf-backend-935131444417.asia-south1.run.app/api/health/ping
```

### 2. Monitor Dashboard

In your Cronitor dashboard, you should see:

- ‚úÖ **Green status** when cron jobs run successfully
- üìä **Execution history** showing regular 14-minute intervals
- üîî **Alerts** if jobs fail or don't run on schedule

## How It Works

### Cron Job Flow

1. **Every 14 minutes**: Node-cron triggers the keep-alive function
2. **Start Signal**: Sends `state: 'run'` to Cronitor
3. **Health Check**: Makes GET request to `/api/health/ping`
4. **Success Signal**: Sends `state: 'complete'` with response time
5. **Error Handling**: Sends `state: 'fail'` if ping fails

### Cronitor URLs

The system uses these Cronitor ping URLs:

```
https://cronitor.link/{MONITOR_KEY}/run     # Job started
https://cronitor.link/{MONITOR_KEY}/complete # Job completed successfully
https://cronitor.link/{MONITOR_KEY}/fail     # Job failed
```

## Monitoring Endpoints

### Health Check Endpoints

- `GET /api/health` - Basic health check
- `GET /api/health/ping` - Lightweight ping endpoint for cron job
- `GET /api/health/detailed` - Detailed health with database status

### Cron Management Endpoints

- `GET /api/cron/status` - Get cron job status and statistics
- `POST /api/cron/ping` - Trigger manual ping
- `POST /api/cron/test-cronitor` - Test Cronitor connection
- `POST /api/cron/start` - Start cron job (if stopped)
- `POST /api/cron/stop` - Stop cron job

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Cronitor Not Receiving Pings

- Verify `CRONITOR_MONITOR_KEY` environment variable
- Check monitor status in Cronitor dashboard
- Test connection: `POST /api/cron/test-cronitor`

#### 2. Server Still Going to Sleep

- Check cron job status: `GET /api/cron/status`
- Verify 14-minute schedule is running
- Monitor success/error counts

#### 3. Environment Variables Not Set

- Ensure all required env vars are set in Render
- Check server logs for configuration warnings
- Test with: `GET /api/cron/status`

### Logs to Monitor

Watch these log messages:

```
‚úÖ Keep-alive cron job initialized successfully
‚úÖ Keep-alive ping successful
‚ùå Keep-alive ping failed
‚úÖ Cronitor ping sent: complete
```

## Security Notes

- The API key (`b612058cd75c4f23a6f7674fb9e8c09c`) is already included
- Monitor keys are public and safe to use in URLs
- All endpoints use HTTPS for secure communication
- Rate limiting is disabled for health check endpoints

## Alert Configuration

In Cronitor dashboard, configure alerts for:

- **Missing executions**: When cron job doesn't run on schedule
- **Failed executions**: When ping requests fail
- **Performance degradation**: When response times increase significantly

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Deploy the updated backend to Render
2. ‚úÖ Create Cronitor monitor using the dashboard
3. ‚úÖ Add environment variables to Render
4. ‚úÖ Monitor the dashboard for successful pings
5. ‚úÖ Set up alert notifications (email, Slack, etc.)

The system will now automatically keep your Render server awake and provide comprehensive monitoring of its health status.
