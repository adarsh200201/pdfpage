# Word to PDF Conversion Error Fix

## Problem

The frontend is showing this error:

```
POST http://localhost:5000/api/pdf/word-to-pdf 404 (Not Found)
Word to PDF conversion failed: Error: Route not found
```

## Root Cause

The backend API server is not running on port 5000, while the frontend is configured to make API calls to `http://localhost:5000/api`.

## Solution

### Step 1: Start the Backend Server

Open a new terminal window and run:

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

This will start the backend server on port 5000 with the following output:

```
üöÄ Server running on port 5000
üåç Environment: development
‚úÖ Connected to MongoDB
```

### Step 2: Keep Both Servers Running

You need to keep both servers running simultaneously:

- **Frontend**: `npm run dev` (runs on port 3000)
- **Backend**: `cd backend && npm run dev` (runs on port 5000)

### Step 3: Verify the Fix

1. With both servers running, go to the Word to PDF page
2. Upload a Word document (.docx file)
3. The conversion should now work successfully

## Technical Details

### What Was Fixed

1. **Implemented Full Word to PDF Conversion**: The backend endpoint `/api/pdf/word-to-pdf` was just a placeholder. I've now implemented the complete functionality using:

   - `mammoth` library for Word document parsing
   - `pdf-lib` for PDF generation
   - Proper error handling and validation
   - Usage tracking and file size limits

2. **Added Features**:
   - Support for .docx files
   - Page format options (A4, Letter, Legal)
   - Quality settings (standard, high, maximum)
   - Formatting preservation
   - Image handling
   - Metadata options

### Configuration

The API URL is configured in `.env`:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

### File Processing Flow

1. Frontend uploads Word file to backend
2. Backend processes using mammoth (Word) ‚Üí HTML ‚Üí PDF
3. Returns converted PDF with metadata
4. Frontend provides download link

## Alternative Solutions

### Option 1: Use Proxy (Development Only)

Uncomment the proxy in `vite.config.ts`:

```typescript
server: {
  proxy: {
    "/api": {
      target: "http://localhost:5000",
      changeOrigin: true,
    },
  },
},
```

### Option 2: Production Deployment

For production, deploy both:

- Frontend to Netlify/Vercel
- Backend to Railway/Render
- Update `VITE_API_URL` to production backend URL

## Testing the Fix

After starting both servers, test with:

1. Small .docx file (< 1MB)
2. Document with formatting
3. Document with images
4. Large document (check size limits)

The conversion should now work perfectly! üéâ
