# CSP and PDF.js Configuration Fix

## Problem Description

The application was experiencing Content Security Policy (CSP) violations that prevented PDF.js from loading its workers, resulting in errors like:

```
Refused to create a worker from 'blob:...' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'..."
Refused to load the script 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/pdfjs-dist@4.8.69/build/pdf.worker.min.mjs' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive...
Error reading PDF: Error: Setting up fake worker failed
```

## Root Cause

The CSP configuration in `netlify.toml` was too restrictive and didn't allow:

1. External CDN scripts (jsdelivr.net, unpkg.com)
2. Blob workers (used by PDF.js)
3. Worker-src directives

## Solution Overview

### 1. Updated CSP Configuration (`netlify.toml`)

**Before:**

```
Content-Security-Policy = "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https://www.google-analytics.com https://www.googletagmanager.com; ..."
```

**After:**

```
Content-Security-Policy = "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' blob: data: https://www.google-analytics.com https://www.googletagmanager.com https://cdn.jsdelivr.net https://unpkg.com; worker-src 'self' blob: data: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net https://unpkg.com; ..."
```

**Key Changes:**

- Added `blob:` and `data:` to `script-src` for blob workers
- Added `worker-src` directive to explicitly allow worker sources
- Added `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net` and `https://unpkg.com` for CDN access

### 2. Enhanced PDF.js Configuration

#### Worker Configuration Script (`public/pdf.worker.config.js`)

- Tests multiple worker sources in order of preference
- Provides fallback mechanisms
- Emits events to notify the application of configuration status
- Handles CSP restrictions gracefully

#### Updated PDF Configuration (`src/lib/pdf-config.ts`)

- Enhanced worker source testing
- Multiple fallback strategies
- Browser-based configuration testing
- Integration with worker configuration script

#### Improved Vite Configuration (`vite.config.ts`)

- Better handling of PDF worker files
- Proper asset naming for workers
- Optimized chunk splitting for PDF libraries

### 3. Fallback Mechanisms

#### Local Worker Fallback (`public/pdf.worker.min.mjs`)

- Minimal fallback worker for when CDN sources fail
- Can be served from the same domain
- Provides basic functionality indicator

#### Enhanced PDF Service (`src/services/pdfService.ts`)

- Graceful worker creation with CSP error handling
- Automatic fallback to main-thread processing
- Multiple CDN source attempts
- Error recovery mechanisms

### 4. Testing and Verification

#### CSP Test Page (`public/csp-test.html`)

- Comprehensive testing of worker sources
- Blob worker creation tests
- PDF.js initialization verification
- Real-time results display

## How to Test the Fix

### 1. Automatic Testing

Visit `/csp-test.html` to run automated tests that verify:

- Worker source accessibility
- Blob worker creation
- PDF.js initialization

### 2. Manual Testing

1. Upload a PDF file to any PDF tool
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify PDF processing works correctly

### 3. Development Testing

```bash
npm run dev
# Navigate to any PDF tool and test functionality
```

## Fallback Strategy

The solution implements a multi-tier fallback strategy:

1. **Primary**: CDN workers (jsdelivr.net)
2. **Secondary**: Alternative CDN (unpkg.com)
3. **Tertiary**: Local fallback worker
4. **Final**: Main-thread processing (no worker)

## Browser Support

The fix maintains compatibility with all modern browsers while providing enhanced error handling for environments with strict CSP policies.

## Performance Considerations

- CDN workers provide optimal performance
- Local fallback maintains functionality
- Main-thread processing ensures compatibility
- Chunk optimization reduces bundle size

## Security Considerations

The CSP updates maintain security while enabling functionality:

- Only trusted CDN sources are allowed
- Blob workers are restricted to same-origin
- No additional security risks introduced
- Maintains protection against XSS attacks

## Deployment Notes

### Netlify

The CSP changes in `netlify.toml` will automatically apply on deployment.

### Other Hosting Providers

For other providers, apply similar CSP headers:

```
script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' blob: data: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net https://unpkg.com;
worker-src 'self' blob: data: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net https://unpkg.com;
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Console Monitoring

Monitor browser console for:

- CSP violation warnings
- PDF worker configuration messages
- Fallback activation notices

### Performance Monitoring

- Worker initialization time
- PDF processing performance
- Error rates and recovery

### Updates

When updating PDF.js version:

1. Update worker URLs in configuration
2. Test with CSP test page
3. Verify fallback mechanisms

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**PDF.js still not loading:**

1. Check CSP headers are applied correctly
2. Verify CDN accessibility
3. Test with CSP test page
4. Check browser console for specific errors

**Worker creation fails:**

1. Confirm blob: is allowed in CSP
2. Check worker-src directive
3. Verify fallback mechanisms activate

**Performance issues:**

1. Check which fallback tier is being used
2. Monitor network requests for worker loading
3. Verify chunk optimization is working

### Debug Commands

```javascript
// Check current PDF configuration
console.log(window.PDFJS_WORKER_SRC);
console.log(window.PDFJS_DISABLE_WORKER);

// Test worker configuration
window.configurePDFWorker();

// Check CSP compliance
// (Look for CSP violation errors in console)
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Service Worker Caching**: Cache PDF workers for offline use
2. **Dynamic CSP**: Implement runtime CSP adjustments
3. **Worker Pool**: Implement worker pooling for better performance
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Enhanced features based on available capabilities
