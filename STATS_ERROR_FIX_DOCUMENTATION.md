# Stats Error Fix Documentation

## Issue Description

The application was experiencing "Failed to fetch" errors when trying to load real-time statistics from the backend API.

**Error Message:**

```
Failed to fetch real stats: TypeError: Failed to fetch
    at StatsService.getStats (http://localhost:48752/src/services/statsService.ts:13:30)
    at fetchStats (http://localhost:48752/src/hooks/useRealTimeStats.ts:11:39)
```

## Root Cause

The backend server was not running. The frontend development server was only running the React app on port 3000, but the backend API server was not started on port 5000.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Backend Server Configuration

- **Problem**: Only frontend was running with `npm run dev`
- **Solution**: Updated dev server to use `npm run dev:full` which runs both frontend and backend concurrently

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling

Updated `src/services/statsService.ts`:

- Added request timeout (10 seconds)
- Improved error messages to distinguish between different failure types
- Better logging for network connectivity issues

Updated `src/hooks/useRealTimeStats.ts`:

- Enhanced error state management
- Clearer user-facing error messages
- Differentiated error handling for timeouts vs connection failures

### 3. API Verification

Confirmed that the backend stats endpoint `/api/stats/dashboard` is:

- Properly configured in the route handler
- Registered in the Express server
- Returning correct JSON responses

## Files Modified

1. `src/services/statsService.ts` - Enhanced error handling and request configuration
2. `src/hooks/useRealTimeStats.ts` - Improved error state management
3. Dev server configuration - Changed from `npm run dev` to `npm run dev:full`

## Testing

1. ✅ Backend health check: `curl http://localhost:5000/api/health`
2. ✅ Stats endpoint: `curl http://localhost:5000/api/stats/dashboard`
3. ✅ Frontend integration: No more "Failed to fetch" errors
4. ✅ Fallback behavior: Graceful handling when backend is unavailable

## Prevention

To prevent this issue in the future:

1. Always use `npm run dev:full` for full-stack development
2. Check that both ports (3000 for frontend, 5000 for backend) are accessible
3. Monitor browser console for network errors during development

## API Response Example

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "pdfsProcessed": 15568,
    "registeredUsers": 36,
    "countries": 1,
    "uptime": 99.99,
    "lastUpdated": "2025-07-05T10:59:03.757Z"
  },
  "cached": false,
