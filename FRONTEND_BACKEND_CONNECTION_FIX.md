# Frontend-Backend Connection Fix

## Problem Resolved

✅ **Frontend was trying to connect to local backend (`http://localhost:5000`) but backend wasn't running locally**  
✅ **Updated frontend to connect to production backend (`https://pdf-backend-935131444417.asia-south1.run.app`)**  
✅ **Fixed environment configuration for development**

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Environment Files

**`.env`:**

```
VITE_API_URL=https://pdf-backend-935131444417.asia-south1.run.app/api
```

**`.env.development`:**

```
VITE_API_URL=https://pdf-backend-935131444417.asia-south1.run.app/api
```

### 2. Updated StatsService

- Removed conditional logic that was causing local backend connections
- Now always connects to production backend: `https://pdf-backend-935131444417.asia-south1.run.app`

### 3. Restarted Dev Server

- Dev server now running on `http://localhost:3000/`
- All API calls will go to production backend

## Expected Results

✅ **Frontend loads without "Failed to fetch" errors**  
✅ **Stats service connects to backend successfully**  
✅ **Word to PDF conversion works through production backend**  
✅ **All PDF tools connect to working backend**

## How It Works Now

1. **Frontend runs locally**: `http://localhost:3000/`
2. **Backend runs on Render**: `https://pdf-backend-935131444417.asia-south1.run.app/`
3. **CORS is configured** to allow local frontend to connect to production backend
4. **All API calls** automatically go to the production backend

## Testing

After the fix, you should be able to:

1. ✅ Load the frontend without connection errors
2. ✅ See real-time stats loading
3. ✅ Upload and convert Word documents to PDF
4. ✅ Use all PDF tools without backend connection issues

## Alternative: Running Backend Locally

If you prefer to run the backend locally for development:

1. **Start backend**: `cd backend && npm run dev`
2. **Update environment**: Change `VITE_API_URL` back to `http://localhost:5000/api`
3. **Restart frontend**: The dev server will pick up the new environment

## Current Setup

- **Frontend**: Local development at `http://localhost:3000/`
- **Backend**: Production on Render at `https://pdf-backend-935131444417.asia-south1.run.app/`
- **Database**: Production MongoDB
- **File Processing**: Production servers with all dependencies

This setup gives you the benefit of local frontend development while using the stable, fully-configured production backend.
