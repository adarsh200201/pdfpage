# 🎯 Logo Consistency Fix Report

## ✅ **Issue Identified & Resolved**

**Problem**: Multiple different logo URLs were being used across the project, causing inconsistent branding and favicon issues.

**Root Cause**: Different asset IDs were being referenced:
- ❌ Mixed usage of different Builder.io asset IDs  
- ❌ Some references to `/logo.png` that might not exist
- ❌ Inconsistent format parameters (webp vs png)

## 🔧 **Solutions Implemented**

### 1. **Centralized Logo Configuration**
- Created `src/config/logo-config.ts` for consistent logo management
- Standardized all references to use the official red "PP" logo
- Official asset ID: `5791d498f9994470ae52d766d30e56ee`

### 2. **Updated Components**
- ✅ `PdfPageLogo.tsx` - Uses centralized config
- ✅ `Header.tsx` - Mobile and desktop logos standardized  
- ✅ `ImgHeader.tsx` - Updated to larger, clearer logo
- ✅ `FaviconHeader.tsx` - Consistent sizing and source

### 3. **Fixed Structured Data & SEO**

- ✅ `manifest.json` - Consistent PWA icon sources
- ✅ `GoogleKnowledgePanelOptimizer.tsx` - Standardized logo URL
- ✅ `public/logo.svg` - Updated to match official design

### 4. **Logo Visibility Improvements**
- **Larger Sizes**: Increased logo sizes across all headers
- **Better Contrast**: Added white background and borders  
- **Enhanced Brand Text**: Red "Pdf" + black "Page" for clarity
- **PNG Format**: Using PNG for better compatibility in structured data
